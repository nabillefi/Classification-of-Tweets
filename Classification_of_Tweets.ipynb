    "## Twitter\n",
    "Twitter est un service de réseautage social et de micro-blogging sur lequel les utilisateurs publient et interagissent les uns avec les autres via des messages appelés «tweets». Il est classé au 6e rang des sites et applications de réseautage social les plus populaires par Dream Grow en avril 2020 avec une moyenne de 330 millions d'utilisateurs actifs par mois.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spécifications\n",
    "Imaginons que vous avez un compte Twitter, et que vous lez suivre les tweets (texte très court) sur ce réseau social. Vu le nombre colossal de Tweets, et faute de temps, vous n’avez pas la possibilité de les lire tous. Pour cela, vous avez besoin d’une application qui va jouer le rôle d’assistantet qui va vous effectuer un résumé de toutes ces informations. Une des approches qu’on peut utiliser estde le classer sous former de groupes de sorte à ce qu’on présente à l’utilisateur un seul Tweet de chaque groupe. Pour cela, on doit procéder en trois grandes étapes :\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Prétraitement des tweets\n",
    "Dans cette étape, l’objectif est d’éliminer le texte inutile des tweets tels que les #, les noms des utilisateurs, les url, …\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Traitement des tweets : NLP (Natural LanguageProcessing) On doit procéder à l’analyse du tweet en respectant les différentes étapes du NLP (Natural LanguageProcessing). La bibliothèque à utiliser est NLTK en Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- Classification des tweets Etant donné un ensemble de tweets, l’objectif est de les résumer sous formes de groupes de sorte à ce que les Tweets qui sont dans le même groupe soient similaires. Ainsi, l’utilisateur pourra par la suite lire juste un Tweet de chaque groupe (le Tweet qui est le centroïde de groupes).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Travail à Faire\n",
    "* On a Telecharger les tweets a partir de Twitter en utilisant l'API de twitter. Pour cela, vous devriez un compte « Twitter Developper ». Pour cela, vous devriez telecharger au moins 10 mille twwets.\n",
    "* On Utiliser la bibliothèque NLTK pour effectuer une analyse de chaque tweet et le transformer en un ensemble de mots en suivant les différentes étapes de base du processus NLP (Natural LanguageProcessing). Pour la documentation sur NLTK et les différentes phases du NLP. Utiliser l’algorithme K-Means pour classer les Tweets en k classes (vous pouvez essayer plusieurs valeurs de k allant de 3 à 30 par exemple).\n",
    "* Après avoir récupéré les classes, choisissez un Tweet par classe comme représentant. Les Tweets choisis seront les résumés de toutes les informations contenues dans les Tweets."
